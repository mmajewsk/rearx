While some\ncontemporary foundation models demonstrate potential, they are hindered by\ninsufficient cross-task adaptability and primarily process low-resolution\nimagery of restricted sizes, thus failing to fully exploit high-resolution data\nor leverage comprehensive large-scene semantics. Crucially, remote sensing\nimagery differs fundamentally from natural images, as key foreground targets\n(eg., maritime objects, artificial structures) often occupy minimal spatial\nproportions (~1%) and exhibit sparse distributions. Efficiently modeling\ncross-task generalizable knowledge from lengthy 2D tokens (~100,000) poses a\nsignificant challenge yet remains critical for remote sensing image\nunderstanding. Motivated by the selective attention mechanisms inherent to the\nhuman visual system, we propose DynamicVis, a dynamic visual perception\nfoundation model for remote sensing imagery. The framework integrates a novel\ndynamic region perception backbone based on the selective state space model,\nwhich strategically balances localized detail extraction with global contextual\nintegration, enabling computationally efficient encoding of large-scale data\nwhile maintaining architectural scalability. To enhance cross-task knowledge\ntransferring, we introduce a multi-instance learning paradigm utilizing\nmeta-embedding representations, trained on million-scale region-level\nannotations. Evaluations across nine downstream tasks demonstrate the model's\nversatility.

To address this asymmetry,\nwe introduce PODS (Policy Optimization with Down-Sampling), a framework that\nstrategically decouples these phases by generating numerous rollouts in\nparallel but updating only on an informative subset. Within this framework, we\ndevelop max-variance down-sampling, a theoretically motivated method that\nselects rollouts with maximally diverse reward signals. We prove that this\napproach has an efficient algorithmic solution, and empirically demonstrate\nthat GRPO with PODS using max-variance down-sampling achieves superior\nperformance over standard GRPO on the GSM8K benchmark."}, {"arxiv_id": "2504.13816", "title": "Analyzing LLMs' Knowledge Boundary Cognition Across Languages Through\n  the Lens of Internal Representations", "authors": ["Chenghao Xiao", "Hou Pong Chan", "Hao Zhang", "Mahani Aljunied", "Lidong Bing", "Noura Al Moubayed", "Yu Rong"], "published": "2025-04-18T17:44:12Z", "citations": 0, "tweets": 1, "paper_link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13816v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "abstract": "While understanding the knowledge boundaries of LLMs is crucial to prevent\nhallucination, research on knowledge boundaries of LLMs has predominantly\nfocused on English. In this work, we present the first study to analyze how\nLLMs recognize knowledge boundaries across different languages by probing their\ninternal representations when processing known and unknown questions in\nmultiple languages. Our empirical studies reveal three key findings: 1) LLMs'\nperceptions of knowledge boundaries are encoded in the middle to middle-upper\nlayers across different languages. 2) Language differences in knowledge\nboundary perception follow a linear structure, which motivates our proposal of\na training-free alignment method that effectively transfers knowledge boundary\nperception ability across languages, thereby helping reduce hallucination risk\nin low-resource languages; 3) Fine-tuning on bilingual question pair\ntranslation further enhances LLMs' recognition of knowledge boundaries across\nlanguages.

However, reward\nhacking issues with PRMs limit their successful application in reinforcement\nfine-tuning. In this paper, we identify the main cause of PRM-induced reward\nhacking: the canonical summation-form credit assignment in reinforcement\nlearning (RL), which defines the value as cumulative gamma-decayed future\nrewards, easily induces LLMs to hack steps with high rewards. To address this,\nwe propose PURE: Process sUpervised Reinforcement lEarning. The key innovation\nof PURE is a min-form credit assignment that formulates the value function as\nthe minimum of future rewards. This method significantly alleviates reward\nhacking by limiting the value function range and distributing advantages more\nreasonably. Through extensive experiments on 3 base models, we show that\nPRM-based approaches enabling min-form credit assignment achieve comparable\nreasoning performance to verifiable reward-based methods within only 30% steps.\nIn contrast, the canonical sum-form credit assignment collapses training even\nat the beginning! Additionally, when we supplement PRM-based fine-tuning with\njust 10% verifiable rewards, we further alleviate reward hacking and produce\nthe best fine-tuned model based on Qwen2.5-Math-7B in our experiments,\nachieving 82.5% accuracy on AMC23 and 53.3% average accuracy across 5\nbenchmarks.

This allows us to cleanly and controllably\nquantify the creative limits of the present-day language model. Much like\nreal-world tasks that require a creative, far-sighted leap of thought, our\ntasks require an implicit, open-ended stochastic planning step that either (a)\ndiscovers new connections in an abstract knowledge graph (like in wordplay,\ndrawing analogies, or research) or (b) constructs new patterns (like in\ndesigning math problems or new proteins).
